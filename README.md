    Namespaces and Headers ➠ Never put using namespace ... in a header.

    Headers are included in other files; anything that exists in a header will be included. If you put a using namespace ... statement in a header, and the header gets included in some module that uses an identifier with the same name as one from the namespace, we will have ambiguity at compilation time. This ambiguity cannot be solved unless we can modify the header, which is not always possible. As such, we write the headers not to create any side-effects in files that include them.

    The main module contained code to prevent this, but it seems to have been changed. Do not change provided code unless you are specifically instructed to do so.

Please don't just copy the code mindlessly without trying to solve the problems yourself

## P/S
All of my notes will be held on main.cpp for each week lectures <br>
Also there is a practice code that I usually upload each week <br>

Have a good study <br>
